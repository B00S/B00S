- 👋 Hi, I’m @B00S
- 👀 I’m interested in education (I'm a teacher and deputy principal), web development, gamification of learning, and the ways tech can enhance our lives. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can contribute domain knowledge to ... hopefully soon my technical skills will be useful. 
- 📫 How to reach me @scottbooth on Twitter.
